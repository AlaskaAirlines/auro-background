# Background

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (FILE:src=./../docs/partials/description.md) -->
<!-- The below content is automatically added from ./../docs/partials/description.md -->
The `auro-background` element is an easy-to-use mobile-first alternative to writing custom CSS for background colors or images with automatically scoped media queries. Use independently or in the slot of another custom element such as `auro-banner`.

### Design Token CSS Custom Property dependency

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/development/designTokens.md) -->
The use of any Auro custom element has a dependency on the [Auro Design Tokens](https://auro.alaskaair.com/getting-started/developers/design-tokens).

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

### CSS Custom Property fallbacks

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/usage/cssFallbacks.md) -->
[CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) are [not supported](https://auro.alaskaair.com/support/custom-properties) in older browsers. For this, fallback properties are pre-generated and included with the npm.

Any update to the Auro Design Tokens will be immediately reflected with browsers that support CSS custom properties, legacy browsers will require updated components with pre-generated fallback properties.

## Install bundled assets from CDN

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/usage/bundleInstallDescription.md) -->
In cases where the project is not able to process JS assets, there are pre-processed assets available for use. See -- `auro-background__bundled.js` for modern browsers. Legacy browsers such as IE11 are no longer supported.

**WARNING!** When installing into your application environment, DO NOT use `@latest` for the requested version. Risks include unknown MAJOR version releases and instant adoption of any new features and possible bugs without developer knowledge. The `@latest` wildcard should NEVER be used for production customer-facing applications. You have been warned.

## auro-background use cases

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (FILE:src=./../docs/partials/useCases.md) -->
<!-- The below content is automatically added from ./../docs/partials/useCases.md -->
The `auro-background` component accepts 4 properties - `bg`, `height`, `width`, and `inset` that serve as the default at all breakpoints. `height`, `width`, and `inset` are not required and sizing will scale to the content when omitted. Additionally, there is a separate property for each supported breakpoint (`bgsm`, `bgmd`, `bglg`, `heightsm`, `heightmd`, `heightlg`, `widthsm`, `widthmd`, `widthlg`).  If you don't set specific size property the smaller property will be used.

These properties map to the compound CSS `background` property and CSS properties of `height`, `width`, and `padding`. Anything you can do within the scope of those CSS rules you can do here.

See <auro-hyperlink target="_blank" href="https://webcode.tools/generators/css/background-image">CSS Background Image Generator</auro-hyperlink> for a helpful code generation tool.
